* Make more generic to RF69 chips seperate/remove pi443 specifics
* DIO Pins Mapping Configuration (optional pins)
* Add Alternate Frequency Support
* Detect? and support all module frequency versions (specify in overlay/acpi?) 
	*RFM69xxx-315S2 - 315MHz band
	*RFM69xxx-433S2 - 433MHz band
	*RFM69xxx-868S2 - 868MHz band
	*RFM69xxx-915S2 - 915MHz band
* add compatible strings for each chip/baseband combination if auto detection not possible

* Add support for Continuous Mode



* acpi compatibility





* coding style does not fully comply with the kernel style guide.
* still TODOs, annotated in the code
* currently the code introduces new IOCTLs. I'm afraid this is a bad idea.
  -> Replace this with another interface, hints are welcome!
* Some missing data (marked with ###) needs to be added in the documentation
